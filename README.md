# README

While each of the course or guide content repositories include content and metadata necessary for deployment,
Spring Academy does require cross-cutting type of configuration.

This repo includes the metadata common across courses, guides and learning paths including:

- Instructors profiles
- Pages (independent of course or guide content)
- Learning Paths
- Exam/Certification References
- Educates Training Portal and Workshop references
