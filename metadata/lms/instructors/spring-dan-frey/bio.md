I have been involved in the Spring Community since 2004. In that time I've touched on all aspects of the Spring Framework and derivative projects. I've worked with numerous Spring Project teams and have contributed code to a number of those projects.

My current role has me focused on helping clients best utilize Spring and its capabilities in various Cloud Environments. This includes best practices for enabling these capabilities in these cloud environments, how best to automate moving applications to these environments, as well as focusing on how these workloads perform in said environments once they've been deployed.

When I'm not actively engaged with clients, you can find me focusing on my family and out in the workshop on various woodworking projects.
