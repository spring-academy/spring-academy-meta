I am an Engineering Manager responsible for overseeing a few teams in the Spring portfolio. I have a history using Spring as a software engineer inside of a Fortune 100 company and I still dabble around the edges in some areas of Spring. My day job and my passion are helping the Spring engineers however I can.

When I'm not at work or with my family I hope I'm doing something related to soccer.
