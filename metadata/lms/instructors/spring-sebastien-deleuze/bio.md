Based in Lyon (France), I am a Spring Framework core committer at VMware. I work mostly on Web, Kotlin, infrastructure and efficiency related topics like GraalVM native image and JVM Checkpoint Restore support.

I am a WebAssembly believer since 2016, a Kotlin Google Developer Expert and I have been a MiXiT (the conference for ethics and diversity in tech with crÃªpes and love) staff member.
